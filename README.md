# StringLengthWebApp
A simple web application that adds strings to a database and returns the length of the string to the user.

To use the program, you will have to download both the 'changeString.py' file and 'templates' folder containing the file, 'change_string.html'. The program requires flask, and sqlite3. After you run the program, go to the URL localhost:5000/change_string and input a string to be added to the database. The program will create the database when run for the first time. Subsequent runs will update the table in the database with strings added on the page.

Enjoy.
